## **About Me**

Once upon a lazy Sunday morning, I was scrolling through YouTube looking for something random to watch. Out of nowhere, a video titled *"C++ Programming Tutorial for Beginners"* popped into my feed.  
Curious, I clicked on it. One video turned into two, then three. Before I knew it, I had downloaded something called **Dev C++**. That entire Sunday… was spent trying to print just one damn line:  
> `hello world`

But that one line changed everything.  
No teachers. No classes. No books.  
**Just me and the internet** — my greatest classroom.

Fast forward to today:  
I'm a self-taught developer, mainly working with **Python** and **Node.js**, creating everything from silly weekend projects to tools for **web development** and **cybersecurity**. I don't code to make perfect things. I code because I love the chaos, the bugs, the joy when something finally works after hours of pain.

> I'm not just another dev. I'm your local bowl of spicy code-flavored `Chanh`.

A Note to Beginners

If you're new to coding, or even if you've never written a line of code —
You're not late. You're not behind. You're just getting started.

You don’t need a degree.
You don’t need to be a genius.
You just need curiosity, patience, and maybe... a little caffeine.

So keep building. Keep breaking things.
And remember: even hello world can change your life.
